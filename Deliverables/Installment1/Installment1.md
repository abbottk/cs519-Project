## Software project
Our software project (myTunes) is a modification of the UI for the iTunes media player application. Rather than having text-driven menus, our modified UI will be icon-driven to facilitate reasoning about what menu items actually do. In addition, the icon-driven menu system will allow users with limited or underdeveloped fine motor skills to interact with them more easily.

## Underrepresented population
We have chosen the preschool age range (3 -- 5 years old) as our underrepresented population.

## Situation/use case for underrepresented population
Accessing digital media.

## What issues make your software a potentially poor fit for this population?
The current version of iTunes is designed for technically knowledgeable users, and menus can be confusing to understand and/or navigate. In addition, menu items can require a level of fine motor skills not available to all potential users.

## Situation/use case for mainstream population
Accessing digital media.

## Justification for project
From a usability standpoint, preschoolers present a unique set of potential challenges for design work. We must account for differences in reasoning, in addition to physical limitations where fine motor schools are concerned. These concerns are translatable to other groups, as well as mainstream users experiencing some kind of diminished capacity for higher level reasoning and/or fine motor skills. Because digital media is ubiquitous in our lives, as well as the lives of preschool children, it is important to address these design needs in a commonly used media player.
