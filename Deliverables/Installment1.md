# Project Installment 1: Project Formation

_Last Updated: 2017-10-02_

### Software project
Our software project is a UI overlay for the Android operating system. When the overlay is initialized users set up "profiles" that have configuration options including age ranges, content filtering settings, and visualization preferences. When a user "logs in" to the operating system using one of these pre-configured profiles, it adjusts the way the UI is presented to the user (i.e. more icon driven, or increased reliance on voice commands, etc...).

### Underrepresented population
We have chosen the preschool age range (3 -- 5 years old) as our underrepresented population.

### Situation/use case for underrepresented population
Using a mobile device to access digital media.

### What issues make your software a potentially poor fit for this population?
The current Android UI has options for creating profiles, however the settings available do not allow for content filtering and don't really modify the UI in any significant way.

### Situation/use case for mainstream population
Using a mobile device to access digital media that has been customized to personal preferences.

### Justification for project
Because setting up mobile device management and filtering of or access to digital media can be a challenge, it often gets done poorly or is skipped altogether. Preschool aged children are a particular concern in this case, because mobile devices are becoming more ubiquitous in their lives and safety is an increasing concern. In addition to benefiting a mainstream population and the preschool population it will assist parents in understanding and configuring user settings and permissions more easily.
