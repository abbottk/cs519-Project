### Software project
Our software project is a digital media player for preschool children. It will provide several features that will allow visualizations like menus and icons to be customized. In addition, it will allow for content filtering and organization. The idea is to provide a simplified UI that allows for customization that will improve the way users perceive, think about, and interact with a digital media player.

### Underrepresented population
We have chosen the preschool age range (3 -- 5 years old) as our underrepresented population.

### Situation/use case for underrepresented population
Using a mobile device to access digital media.

### What issues make your software a potentially poor fit for this population?
Current digital media players are designed for adult users. Menus are confusing for a preschool children, and the content presented may not always be appropriate for them. In addition, menu items can require a level of fine motor skills not available to preschoolers.

### Situation/use case for mainstream population
Using a mobile device to access digital media that has been customized to personal preferences.

### Justification for project
From a usability standpoint, our digital media player will provide users with a fully customizable interface including menus and interaction techniques. For instance some users may find traditional "drop-down" style menus familiar and easy to interact with, but others may prefer icon driven menus. Our software will accommodate these differences. In addition, users may prefer to see only media content that meets some specified criteria, so our software will allow users to set preferences to filter and organize media as well.
