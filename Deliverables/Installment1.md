# Project Installment 1: Project Formation

_Last Updated: 2017-10-02_

### Software project
An application to be installed on a mobile computing device that assists in setting up user permissions and media filtering. This application will be a comprehensive tool for setting and managing visualizations for "available" applications, as well as managing the filtering of content available on those applications. Some additional features might include monitoring capabilities that track usage time and history, and provide settings for limiting usage.

### Underrepresented population
We have chosen the preschool age range (3 -- 5 years old) as our underrepresented population.

### Situation/use case for underrepresented population
Accessing audio and video media.

### What issues make your software a potentially poor fit for this population?
Currently available settings and applications are difficult to understand and modify. This can create issues where permissions are not set appropriately for preschool users.

### Situation/use case for mainstream population
Filtering or searching audio and video media.

### Justification for project
Because setting up mobile device management and filtering of or access to audio and video media can be a challenge, it often gets done poorly or is skipped altogether. Preschool aged children are a particular concern in this case, because mobile devices are becoming more ubiquitous in their lives and safety is an increasing concern. In addition to benefiting a mainstream population and the preschool population it will assist parents in understanding and configuring user settings and permissions more easily.
