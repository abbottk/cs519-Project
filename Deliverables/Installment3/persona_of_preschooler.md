Name: Fred
Age: 4


# Motivation

He spends about 3 hours per day using digital media, and enjoys listening to music and watching TV.

# Attitude Towards Risk

He is generally fairly fearless, and when something goes wrong he is certain to come up with a reason for why. When others try to explain to him that his explanations may not be correct, he is usually quite stubborn and persists that his beliefs are correct.

# Interaction Style

Fred enjoys apps which have large icons that are easy to click on. He also likes bright, bold colors, with high contrast. He does have a hard time clicking on smaller icons or layouts with too many of them, and he sometimes gets lost because he is too focused on one part of an app.

# Approach to Technology

His exposure to technology is limited in that he only gets to play with devices that his parents give him. When he gets a chance to see higher-tech devices he asks his parents if he can have them. 

# Approach to Learning

Fred has a short attention span and so tutorials for apps have to not be too long. He has difficulty doing more than one thing at a time, and has trouble viewing the world from other people's perspective. Because of this, he only enjoys tutorials that focus on the things he wants to learn about.
