## Gestation Information
### Underrepresented Population Persona
**Fred (Frederick/Frederica) Smith Persona Foundation**
_Fred represents a fraction of preschooler users with backgrounds similar to em._

- 4 years old
- Attends preschool
- Lives in Portland, Oregon

Fred really likes music, and movies and television. When e is allowed to listen to music, Fred especially likes to listen to music from eir favorite movies and television shows. Before leaving for school Fred must turn off all devices, and focus on getting ready. Media tends to distract Fred from what e is doing when it is left on as "background" noise. During the day, Fred likes to run around and play with friends -- especially outside. At night Fred's parents may allow eir to watch a quiet movie or television show to calm down before bed time.

**Background Knowledge and Skills**
- Fred goes to preschool part time (3 days a week). When e is at home, Fred is comfortable using eir parents smartphone or tablet to listen to music, watch videos, or play apps and games<sup>[2,3,5,6]</sup>.
- Fred likes to use eir imagination, knows eir colors and shapes<sup>[1,4]</sup>. E also enjoys learning about letters and numbers<sup>[1,4]</sup>.

**Motivations and Strategies**
- Motivations: E spends about 3 hours per day using digital media<sup>[5]</sup>, and enjoys listening to music and watching movies or television<sup>[2,5]</sup>.
- Approach to Learning: Fred has a short attention span<sup>[1]</sup> and so tutorials for apps have be short. E has difficulty doing more than one thing at a time<sup>[1]</sup>, and has trouble viewing the world from other people's perspective<sup>[4]</sup>. Because of this, e only enjoys tutorials that focus on the things e wants to learn about<sup>[4]</sup>.
- Attitude to Recovery: E is generally fairly fearless, and when something goes wrong e is certain to come up with a reason for why<sup>[4]</sup>. When others try to explain to em that eir explanations may not be correct, e is usually quite stubborn and persists that eirs beliefs are correct<sup>[4]</sup>.

**Technology and Interaction**
- Interaction Style: Fred enjoys apps which have large icons that are easy to click on<sup>[1,5]</sup>. E also likes bright, bold colors, with high contrast<sup>[1]</sup>. E does have a hard time clicking on smaller icons or layouts with too many of them, and e sometimes gets lost because e is too focused on one part of an app<sup>[1,4,5]</sup>.

### Mainstreamer Population Persona
**Miki (Michael/Michelle) Smith Persona Foundation**
_Miki represents a fraction of adult users with backgrounds similar to em._

- 30 years old
- Employed as an accountant
- Lives in Portland, Oregon

Miki enjoys music and will frequently multitask by listening to it while performing simple activities. It helps eir relieve stress and is useful for concentration.

**Background Knowledge and Skills**

## Concepts


## Prototype
(a) Which concept(s) did you select and why/what criteria you used.
  1. Approach to Learning: for this attribute we chose to go with the micro tutorials, but also to address the overabundance of help text links (as pointed out in the design jam) by making a "centrally located" help button. So, when users select the help text they are presented first with a text-to-audio, and then a micro-tutorial of the item they select to learn about.
  2. Attitude to Recovery: here we decided to use the zoom approach to minimizing information presented. However, we received a lot of feedback during the design jam that having singular options would get tedious for mainstream users. So, we selected what we felt was a "happy medium" where we present a decent amount of information without overloading our population.
  3. Interaction Style: because we're dealing with multiple potential points of access for this software, we felt that the inclusion of flashing icons and positive audio feedback would be the best solution here. Rather than being dependent on a "hover" event, we made it dependent on a "click" event, to provide indication that the user had made a selection.
