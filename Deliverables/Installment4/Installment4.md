<font size="1">_Fred really likes music, and movies and television. When e is allowed to listen to music, Fred especially likes to listen to music from eir favorite movies and television shows. Before leaving for school Fred must turn off all devices, and focus on getting ready. Media tends to distract Fred from what e is doing when it is left on as "background" noise. During the day, Fred likes to run around and play with friends -- especially outside. At night Fred's parents may allow eir to watch a quiet movie or television show to calm down before bed time._</font>

_Background Knowledge and Skills_
  - Fred goes to preschool part time (3 days a week). When e is at home, Fred is comfortable using eir parents smartphones or tablets to listen to music, watch videos, or play apps and games. When Fred's parents change smartphones or upgrade their other devices, it doesn't seem to impair eir use of media.
  - Fred likes to use eir imagination

_Motivations and Strategies_
  - Motivations: E spends about 3 hours per day using digital media<sup>[4](#v11csm)</sup>, and enjoys listening to music and watching movies or television<sup>[4](#v11csm),[2](#gea14aist)</sup>.
  - Approach to Learning: Fred has a short attention span<sup>[1](#bbf02hci)</sup> and so tutorials for apps have be short. E has difficulty doing more than one thing at a time<sup>[1](#bbf02hci)</sup>, and has trouble viewing the world from other people's perspective<sup>[3](#k15lifespan)</sup>. Because of this, e only enjoys tutorials that focus on the things e wants to learn about.
  - Attitude Toward Risk: E is generally fairly fearless, and when something goes wrong e is certain to come up with a reason for why. When others try to explain to em that eir explanations may not be correct, e is usually quite stubborn and persists that eirs beliefs are correct.

_Technology and Interaction_
  - Interaction Style: Fred enjoys apps which have large icons that are easy to click on. E also likes bright, bold colors, with high contrast. E does have a hard time clicking on smaller icons or layouts with too many of them, and e sometimes gets lost because e is too focused on one part of an app.
  - Approach to Technology: Eir exposure to technology is limited in that e only gets to play with devices that his parents give em. When e gets a chance to see higher-tech devices e asks eirs parents if e can have them.
