# Cognitive Development (Slide 4)

**Preoperational reasoning** appears in young children from about ages 2 to 6 and is characterized by a dramatic leap in the use of symbolic thinking that permits young children to use language, interact with others, and play using their own thoughts and imaginations to guide their behavior.

1. **Egocentrism:** the inability to take another person’s point of view or perspective.
2. **Animism:** the belief that inanimate objects are alive and have feelings and intentions.
3. **Centration:** tendency to focus attention on one part of a stimulus or situation and exclude all others. For example, if children are lined up from shortest to tallest, and then you ask a child who the “tallest” is they will correctly identify the tallest child. However, if you ask subsequent questions like “who is the smartest?” or “who is the oldest?” they may identify the tallest child.
4. **Irreversibility:** failure to understand that reversing a process can often undo a process and restore the original state.

# Cognitive Development (Slide 5)

**Information processing perspective** is the development of mental strategies to guide one’s thinking and use one’s cognitive resources more effectively.
1. **Attention:** this improves in the preschool years, and young children are better able to focus and sustain their attention to complete tasks but have difficulty with complex tasks that require them to switch their attention among stimuli.
2. **Memory:** the development of recognition memory (ability to recall a stimulus that has occurred in the past while experiencing it again) increases in preschool years, but recall memory (ability to recall a stimulus that has occurred in the past without experiencing it) lags behind, which can mean that young children require more cues in completing tasks than older children with more fully formed memory strategies.
3. **Theory of Mind:** refers to children’s awareness of their own and other people’s mental processes. For example, 3-year-old children understand the difference between thinking about a cookie and having a cookie.
4. **Metacognition:** young children’s abilities are limited in metacognition and they tend to fail false belief and appearance–reality tasks, suggesting that their abilities to understand the mind and predict what other people are thinking are limited. For example, children who are presented with a familiar Band-Aid box that contains pencils rather than Band-Aids will show surprise but tend to believe that other children will share their knowledge and expect the Band-Aid box to hold pencils.
