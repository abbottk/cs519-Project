## Prototype


## Design Decision Justifications (based on personas and feedback)
### Decisions based on attributes:
  1. Approach to Learning
  2. Approach to Technology
  3. Attitude to Recovery
  4. Interaction Style
  5. Motivations

### Decisions based on feedback:
  1. During design jam #1 we received the feedback that having too many "help texts" might be distracting to a mainstream user, so we adjusted the way we were going to handle this by providing a single help button that allows for multiple outputs depending on the selection for help.
  2. During design jam #1 we received the feedback that having a single item for a category displayed (say a single playlist when you've selected "music") could be frustrating for a mainstream user, so we adjusted the number of selection to allow more visibility without feeling "overwhelming" for our underserved population.
  3. During design jam #1 we received the feedback that the attribute "Attitude Toward Risk" might be a little misleading, so we adjusted it to represent the true meaning of the attribute (Attitude to Recovery). This was based on the fact that we meant to highlight the need to include methods for representation to preschoolers that address their attitudes toward permanence.
