## Use Cases
### Underserved Population
1. In order to distract and entertain Fred for a while, Fred's parents sit em at the table with one of their smartphones open to the iTunes app, and tells em to "watch a movie, listen to music, or open an app." So Fred decides e wants to watch a movie.
2. Fred has been watching a movie and decides e would rather play a game. Fred doesn't quite know how to do this, so e needs some help figuring out how to stop the movie, and returns to the "home" screen where e can select the apps/games menu.

### Mainstreamer Population
1. Miki is exercising and listening to music. When e finishes with eir run, e decides to switch to a movie before heading to the locker room.

## Design Decision Justifications (based on personas and feedback)
### Decisions based on attributes:
  1. Approach to Learning: with this attribute we included help videos that are presented from the user perspective. Each of these videos is designed to be short and limit the number of actions (for the completion of the task), in order to minimize the amount users have to remember or act upon.
  2. Approach to Technology: with this attribute, we wanted to make sure that the interface was easy to pick up if the user hadn't accessed it in a while, or if they switched technology that the interface would translate well.
  3. Attitude to Recovery: in order to keep the users from feeling like selections were "permanent" and previous state could not be recovered, we provide "paths" throughout the interface to allow users to return to an initial state or to switch to a different state easily at any time.
  4. Interaction Style: with this attribute we wanted to provide users positive feedback (icon highlighting, and positive click sounds). In addition, we provided users larger icons with more space to allow selection.
  5. Motivations: the primary design decision for this attribute was to provide users with common options they would use most often when accessing their digital media.

### Decisions based on feedback:
  1. During design jam #1 we received the feedback that having too many "help texts" might be distracting to a mainstream user, so we adjusted the way we were going to handle this by providing a single help button that allows for multiple outputs depending on the selection for help.
  2. During design jam #1 we received the feedback that having a single item for a category displayed (say a single playlist when you've selected "music") could be frustrating for a mainstream user, so we adjusted the number of selection to allow more visibility without feeling "overwhelming" for our underserved population.
  3. During design jam #1 we received the feedback that the attribute "Attitude Toward Risk" might be a little misleading, so we adjusted it to represent the true meaning of the attribute (Attitude to Recovery). This was based on the fact that we meant to highlight the need to include methods for representation to preschoolers that address their attitudes toward permanence.
